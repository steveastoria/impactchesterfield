      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Impact Chesterfield Inc</strong>. We are a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization helping homeless students and 
        their families in Chesterfield County, VA, through School Resource Closets, Material Needs, Temporary Lodging, and Rent Security Deposit Assistance since 2022.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Empowers families experiencing homelessness in Chesterfield County, VA by providing comprehensive support and resources to foster stability and self-sufficiency.</em>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="programs">
      <h2>Our Programs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><Strong>Resource Closets</Strong> - We have established Resource Closets in Harrowgate Elementary School, Falling Creek Elementary School, and Manchester Middle School.
          The Resource Closets are cabinets that usually sit in the Community-In-School Coordinator's office.  Impact Chesterfield fills and refills the cabinets and Community-In-Schools empties and re-empties them.  About 85 students use the Resource Closets.  Closets are refilled between once and twice a month.</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li><Strong>Material Needs</Strong> - We receive requests from the Chesterfield County Public School (CCPS) McKinney-Vento Director seeking items for the homeless
        students, such as clothing, beds, mattresses, tables, lamps, coats, food, etc.  We have supplied items by canvassing members for used items or by seeking donations to purchase items. </li>
        <li> </li>
        <li><Strong>Temporary Lodging</Strong> - When families who lose their permanent residence often need a few nights of lodging to resettle themselves.  We received requests from the 
        CCPS McKinney-Vento Director, and we provide 1 to 3 days of lodging in a local hotel.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li><Strong>Rent Security Deposit Assistance</Strong> - Families who lose their permanent residence will stay in a hotel costing between $2550 and $3000 per month. Because of this high expense, families have a difficult time saving the Rent Security Deposit required to transition out of the hotel.  We assist 
          by providing the Rent Security Deposit.  Families who re-establish themselves in permanent residence are no longer homeless./li>
         <li></li> 
        <li><Strong>Pastdue Rent Assistance</Strong> - We are able to provide very limited Pastdue Rent Assistance because of the enormous cost and our limited funding.  We do consider assisting families who are able to pay back most of their pastdue rent
          themselves, but need more help for the last $500.  In these cases, we will assist with the last $500 or so. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Collaborations</h2>
        <p>
          Impact Chesterfield collaborates with:<br>
          The Chesterfield County Public School McKenny-Vento Director. The McKinney-Vento Director enrolls and provides educational services to all students who lose their permanent residence.  The services include 1) Students remain in their school with the same teacher and classmates, even if the student moves out of the school district. 2) Transportation to school, either by bus or gas card to the family, 3) School fees are waived. McKinney-Vento does not provide material needs, food, or lodging. <br>  
          Community-In-Schools (CIS) - CIS places a person in the high-needs schools. The CIS person coordinates community involvement with such groups as volunteer community members and organizations such as Impact Chesterfield.
